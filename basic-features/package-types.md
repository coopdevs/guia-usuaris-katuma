# Package types

There are five different packages available, with each one differing according to the type of enterprise \(producer or hub\) and whether it has an online shop associated with the profile or not. When you first create your profile and login, you’ll be prompted to select a package. Your selection here dictates the functionality that your profile will have i.e. whether you'll just have a profile, or also a shop. Different packages may also have different fee structures, depending on how your local instance charges. The different packages are described below for Producers and Hubs \(non-producers\)

## For Producers

![The above is an example only, fees vary between OFN instances/countries.](https://openfoodnetwork.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Three-producer-types.png)

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="1\) Producer Profile" %}
 This option allows you to create a profile on the OFN. Your profile is a way for you to share your story with others and makes you visible and contactable to customers and other enterprises who may wish to trade with you. A producer with a profile can also add products, which may be stocked in OFN shopfronts that are coordinated by others.
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="2\) Producer Shop" %}
 This option allows producers to create their own OFN shopfront through which to sell their produce. Note that producers can conduct sales through their own shopfront and/or act as a supplier to another shopfront.
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="3\) Producer Hub" %}
 This option is for producers who wish to sell their own produce, as well and products created by other producers.
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

## For Non-Producers \(Hubs\)

![The above is an example only, fees vary between OFN instances/countries.](https://openfoodnetwork.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Two-hub-types.png)

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="1\) Hub \(Profile Only\)" %}
This option allows you to create a profile on the OFN. Your profile is a way for you to share your story with others and makes you visible and contactable to customers and other enterprises who may wish to trade with you.
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="2\) Hub Shop" %}
This option provides you with a complete online store for your hub, in addition to the profile.
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

If you only want a profile on the OFN, once you've created your account, confirmed your email, and selected a profile-only package, your profile will be live on OFN and you're finished. 

If you want to change or add any details to your profile, continue to [Enterprise Settings](../advanced-features/your-profile/), if not, you're all done.

### Changing Package

You can change your package at any time in the future. This can be done by clicking the ‘**Change package**‘ button on the [dashboard](dashboard.md). Or you can change your producer/non producer status and package by selecting **Enterprise** on the blue horizontal banner, and then editing your enterprise’s settings \(see below\).
