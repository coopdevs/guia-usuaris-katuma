# Enterprise Settings

Enterprise Setting is where you can manage details relating to your profile and/or shopfront.

## Access your Enterprise Settings

1. Click on 'Enterprise' in the blue horizontal menu
2. Click on 'Manage' next to your enterprise

## Primary Details

**Name:** This is the name of your enterprise. It will be the title of your profile \(and store\).

**Primary Producer:** Select the producer box if you are a producer. If your organisation is involved in the local food movement in another capacity, don't select this box \(e.g. food hub, coop, farmer's market, advocacy group\).

\*_Note: only enterprises marked as producers can add products to OFN. Hubs only need to select this option when they sell mixed boxes which they pack, that include items from multiple producers._

**Visible in Search:** If your profile is ready to go public, select visible, and it will show in the OFN's directory and map. If you’re still making adjustments, select not visible, until you are ready.

**Permalink:** You can customise part of the web address which will host to your shop.

**Link to Shop Front:** This is the web address of your shop on the OFN \(if you've chosen a package with shopfront\). You can customise the URL above.

## Address

This information is used to map your enterprise the OFN map. Your exact address won't show if you only have a profile, however if you have a shopfront, your address will show in text form in your shop's contact details tab.

## Contact

**Contact Name:** We ask for a contact name for the OFN’s records. This name will not be displayed on your profile, but will be included in order confirmation emails if you're running a shop.

**Email and Phone and Website:** These contact points will be listed on your OFN profile and shopfront, as a means for others to make contact with you.

## Social

**Facebook address, Instagram, LinkedIn, Twitter:** Links to these pages will be created on your profile and shopfront.

## About

**Short description:** This will be displayed when your profile is viewed in the list. It should be under 1-2 sentences which briefly describe what you do.

**About Us:** This is a longer description of your enterprise. It will be shown when your profile is viewed in full. It should be half to one page long.

## Business Details

**ABN:** this will not be displayed publicly. It is required for shop users who want to print invoices.

**ACN:** this will not be displayed publicly.

**Charge GST?**– If you wish to charge GST for your products select ‘yes’.

## Images

**Logo image:** This will be visible when your profile is viewed in brief, as a pop up window. It will also show on your profile. This image must be square, or it will be cropped/warped.

## Properties \(visible to producers only\)

You can apply properties \(such as free range or certified organic\) to your enterprise. These properties will then be automatically applied to all of your products. For an in depth discussion of properties click [here](https://github.com/coopdevs/guia-usuaris-katuma/tree/44e128f05a3e2f656a055ff5a68d3d8cfe7c2229/advanced-features/products/product-properties.md).

## Users

**Owner:** This is the primary user responsible for this enterprise. They have the power to change all aspects of the profile.

**Notifications:** This is the email address where OFN system correspondence will be directed, i.e. order confirmations etc. If this email differs from your login email, you will need to confirm the email address. This user will have an envelope symbol next to their name in the mangers field.

**Manager:** Other OFN users who have been granted permission to manage this account. Want to add a new manager? You can search for existing emails of users who have registered for an OFN account and add them as managers.

**Invite manager:** This is for adding a manager who is not registered with OFN. When you add them, they'll be sent an email confirmation and when they confirm their email they'll be able to set a password, and login to administer this enterprise.

_\* Note: The following fields are only visible to users who’ve opted to have an online shop. This includes producer run shops, and hub run shops._

## Inventory Settings

Simple users can use the recommended setting. Advanced users who need greater flexibility with product management should consult the [Inventory](https://github.com/coopdevs/guia-usuaris-katuma/tree/44e128f05a3e2f656a055ff5a68d3d8cfe7c2229/advanced-features/products/inventory-tool.md) page of this guide before changing the settings.

## Tag Rules

_\* not visible to profile-only users_

You can customise the shopping options for customer by creating tag rules. For more information about this see [tags and tag rules](https://github.com/coopdevs/guia-usuaris-katuma/tree/44e128f05a3e2f656a055ff5a68d3d8cfe7c2229/advanced-features/shop-setup/tags-and-tag-rules.md).

## Shop Preferences

_\* not visible to profile-only users_

**Shopfront Message**: This message is optional. It will be displayed at the top of your online store, above the product listings. It’s an opportunity to provide basic information to the customer about how your store works. For example, you may explain how your order cycles are structured, or any membership requirements. It could also be a friendly greeting, or a chance to promote specials. An example is below:

**Shopfront Closed Message**: This message will be displayed when your shopfront is closed \(no active order cycle\). It’s a chance to tell customers about how your ordering works, and when the shop will next be open and accepting orders.

**Publicly visible shopfront?**: If you select ‘public’, any shopper will be able to see your shopfront. If you select ‘visible to registered customers only’, shoppers who come to your shop will be prompted to login and only those users who are on your customers list will be given access to your shop.

**Guest Orders?**: If you select ‘allow guest checkout’ shoppers won’t need to login to the OFN to shop with you. If you want shoppers to login before they can place their order, select ‘require login to order’. Note the Guest Orders setting is not applicable if you have chosen ‘visible to registered customers only’ in the setting above.

**Shopfront Category Ordering**: The products within your store are arranged alphabetically, within their product category. You can order the product categories as you’d like them to appear, from top to bottom in your store. E.g. you may wish to have your Meat & Fish products to appear at the top, with your less important Pickles & Preseves appearing further down the shopfront.

**Sort order cycles on shopfront by:** If your shopfront will have [more than one order cycle open at the same time](https://github.com/coopdevs/guia-usuaris-katuma/tree/44e128f05a3e2f656a055ff5a68d3d8cfe7c2229/advanced-features/order-cycles/opening-more-than-one-order-cycle.md) you can select which order they appear in the shopfront. You may sorted them by closing date \(closing soonest first\) or by opening date \(opening soonest first\).
