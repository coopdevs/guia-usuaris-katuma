**Supplier**

Select the enterprise who produces and supplies the product.

{% hint style="info" %}
If you are a producer, this will be you. If you're a hub, remember you’ll only be able to add products to producer profiles which you have created, or if you have been granted permission to manage the products of a producer profile. See [here](create-or-connect-with-your-supplying-producers.md) for more info.
{% endhint %}

**Product name:** Add a title. This is how the product will be displayed in the store.

**Units:** Choose what unit the product is sold in? \(g, kg, L… or item \(bunch, bag, packet\)\)

**Value:** Choose in what value the product is sold in \(ie 100g, 2L, 1 bunch\)

**Display As:** This field automatically shows you how the units and value fields will display, once you have filled the units and value fields. \(i.e. units = kg, value = 2, Display as = 2kg\)

{% hint style="info" %}
Note: If you have selected ‘**items**’ as your unit, the **display as** field will change to ‘**item name’**. Fill this in with the type of item it is. \(i.e. jar, bottle, or bunch\)
{% endhint %}

**Product category:** Select the most appropriate category for this product.

**Price:** Enter the price for the value noted above. Note, this is the base price charged by the producer. Mark-ups and fees are added in Enterprise Fees, Shipping Fees and Payment Methods.

{% hint style="info" %}
In Australia, if you select that this product carries tax, the price you put here will include GST. If you select that this product is GST free, the price you enter will be the GST free price.
{% endhint %}

**On hand:** State how much/many of this product you have available and ready for sale.

Use this field if you want to track your stock levels. As customers place orders, the stock level will reduce, and when the on hand amount reaches zero, the product will no longer be visible in your shop. If you don’t want to track inventory in this way, click 'on demand'.

**On demand:** If you select this box, it will indicate that this product is always available. This stops the software from tracking inventory levels for products, and instead it will always show that the product is in stock.

**Product description:** Tell your customers a little bit about this product.

**Photo:** Upload a photo of this product.

{% hint style="info" %}
We strongly recommend to use clear, accurate and beautiful images of your products. It will make the product more appealing to customers.
{% endhint %}

**Tax category:** If you would like the price of this product to include GST, select **GST** from the drop-down menu. The producer and shop enterprise must be set to charge GST in the [Enterprise Settings](enterprise-settings.md) to do this. If you leave this field blank, or select **none**, or not set the enterprise as being GST registered, the price will not include GST.

### Listing similar products using 'Variants'

If you are listing two products which are very similar, but only vary on price, or size, or flavour, it is best to create a ‘variant’ for that product, rather than creating multiple, separate products.

For example, if you sell lemons for 60c each, or 5 for $2.50, you can create two variants for your ‘lemons’ product, one for each price/quantity combination. Or you might sell two flavours of lamb sausages, rosemary, or chili. Each flavour should be a ‘variant’ of the general product. Creating product variants is discussed in greater depth [here](https://github.com/coopdevs/guia-usuaris-katuma/tree/44e128f05a3e2f656a055ff5a68d3d8cfe7c2229/advanced-features/products/product-variants.md).

Once you have completed a product, click **create**, or if you’d like to add more, click **create and add another**.

When you click **create**, you will be taken to your **Bulk Edit Product** page, where you will see a summary of all of your products.

**Examples**

Some examples of how to list different types of products, and how these listing will present in your online store are provided below.

> Note: For products usually sold by the kg, it’s best to list the product for sale in increments, of 100g or higher. The customer can't order .3 kilograms to get 300g because you can only order in whole numbers, so instead list the item in 100g increments and they can order 3. The size will depend on the product \(e.g. most customers won't purchase 1kg or garlic\). This makes it easier to list and prepare the order.
