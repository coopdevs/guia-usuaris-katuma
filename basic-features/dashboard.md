# Dashboard

The ‘Dashboard’ is the behind the scenes control center of your account. From the dashboard you can manage your profile, and all elements of your online shop, if you have a shopfront.

Access your dashboard from the homepage by first logging in and then clicking on the cog in the top right hand corner, and selecting ‘Administration’ from the dropdown menu.

The screenshots below show the dashboard view for different types of users.
